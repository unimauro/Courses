To Host The Finished Web Page on the Web
You can host the finished product on the web to use or to show it to other people, or pets ;-).

Just upload the files that are emailed to you upon the completion of the course to your hosting service. No server side setup is required (REST is Client-server and layered system!)

Then go to:  <your-domain-name>/kitchenblue.html
